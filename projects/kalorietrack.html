    <div class="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        KalorieTrack is an app design based on a theroretical nutrition app that was owned by Underarmour. It was orginally mainly a fitness tracking app, but after seperating from Underarmour they wanted to rebrand to mainly be a nutrition app.<br>
      </p>
      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <p>For this project I was the designer. I worked with a team of researchers to create personas, userflows, and quick tests to make sure the app functioned as intented.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="discover">
      <h2>Discovery Phase</h2>
      <h3>Personas</h3>
      <p>We worked with three personas for the project.</p>
      <p>Hannah<br>Maria<br>Howard</p>
      <h4>Hannah</h4>
      <p>Hannah values a balanced lifestyle. Because of her 9-5 deskjob she finds it difficult to stay active during the week. Her main goal is to maintain her weight, and knows that keeping track of her nutrition will play a major role in that.</p>
      <h4>Maria</h4>
      <p>Maria is a busy working parent, who is trying to lose the extra weight she has gained the last few years. She needs a simple and effective way to track her nutrition. Because of her hectic schedule she doesn't have the time or energy for a complicated tacking app.</p>
      <h4>Howard</h4>
      <p>Howard has a love/hate relationship with his current fitness tracking app. He wants to maintain a healthy lifestyle but he claims that work "often gets in the way". He wants an app that works like a tool, and not a coach.</p>

      <h5>Takeaways</h5>
      <ul class="takeaway">
        <li>There are multiple reasons to use a nutrition tracking app</li>
        <li>Don't leave out the fitness functionality</li>
        <li>Make it simple</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>User Flows</h3>
    <p>Creating the user flow diagram was really insightful and helpful for the redesign. It helped me begin to think through all that would need to happen for the app to be successful, and what screen I would need to make sure I implemented to ensure a smooth pleasent experience for the user.</p>

    <h5>Takeaways</h5>
    <ul class="takeaway">
      <li>Can't forget about the transtion screens</li>
      <li>The home page needs to be able to access every other page with at most 1-2 taps</li>
      <li>Tab bar is vital to a simple navigation</li>
    </ul>
  

    <div class="design">
      <h2>Design Phase</h2>
      <h3>Sketches</h3>
      <div class="design-imgs">
        <img src="" alt="Sketches for KalorieTrack">
        <img src="" alt="Sketches for KalorieTrack">
        <img src="" alt="Sketches for KalorieTrack">
      </div>
      <p>Through the sketches I was able to start to get an idea of where I wanted the app design to go. I knew I wanted there to a an action button on the right side of the screen to allow users to get to quick, commonly used actions.</p>

      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <h5>Low-Fidelity</h5>
      <div class="design-imgs">
        <img src="" alt="Low-Fidelity wireframe">
      </div>
      <h5>High-Fidelity</h5>
      <div class="design-imgs">
        <img src="" alt="High-Fidelity wireframe">
        <img src="" alt="High-Fidelity wireframe">
        <img src="" alt="High-Fidelity wireframe">
        <img src="" alt="High-Fidelity wireframe">
        <img src="" alt="High-Fidelity wireframe">
      </div>
      <p>
        Through the course of the wireframes I was really able to get the direction of the app in place. The color pallete started off going in the wrong direction. I played around with the pallete until I found one that I really liked.<br>
        I was also able to lock in the final design layout.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="final">
      <h2>Final Design</h2>
      <p>To wrap up the project, after getting the design, and colors locked in, I designed a few log in screens to show the log in process for the app.</p>
