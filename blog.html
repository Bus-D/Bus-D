        <h2>Site Buider and Hosting</h2>
        <p>
            This week was pretty simple. Granted I didn't have as much time as I would've liked to get the beginning of my website built up, but I got enough done to be a beginning. I was hoping to be able to get enough of my website build that it could actually be semi usable, but I was only able to get one portfolio piece holder ready. Fortunately, in the coming weeks, adding the rest in will be easy. I just need to do a little more designing, and planning on the rest of the website so that it can function how I want it to. Choosing the host was fairly easy. I had already used Netlify to host a website that I have been working on, so I knew that they were both free, and easy to use. While researching I began to question if choosing Netlify was the best option as the free version didn't have as many benefits. But I sent a a message to my professor and he eased my fears about it, so I went a head and choose Netlify

        <h2>Site Design</h2>
        <p>
            Learning about different parts of web design is something that has began to interst me more and more. Especially as I have continued to progress in my UX degree. It was fun to look at and see the different aspects of web design that the videos and classmates pointed out. One thing that I found interesting is how people in the class reacted to the idea of a side nav bar. I was amused that some people seemed very against it while canvas has a side nav bar, I'm not saying this to judge them, but I wonder how many people read that and realized that canvas has a side nav bar. While the convention is to have it on top of the screen, as long as it is easily found and easy to use, most people won't care where it is. A very important part of web design is making it simple. Users don't want to have to think about what they need to do, they just want to be able to do it. Our job as web designers is to make sure they can look at a website and feel like they already know what to do

        <h2>Licenses, Taxes, and Legal Stuff</h2>
        <p>
            Learning about the licenses and registrations that need to happen with a business was a little overwhelming. I coudn't find anything that said "you need to get this, this and this", everything was just saying you might need this, or read to see if you need this. I was a little annoyed with that because the state knows what I would need. The main thing that I need to get is a DBA (doing business as). Since I will be starting as a sole proprietor, this would allow me to operate under a different name than mine. Since I plan to have a business name that is not my name, I would need one in order to legally operate and do business. Having a DBA will also allow me to legally keep my name private if I wish to, that isn't something that I planed to do, but it's good to know that it is an option if I need to do that

        <h2>Google Ads & Keywords</h2>
        <p>Learning how the keywords and google ads work was really interesting. It never occured to me how difficult it would be to come up with keywords that would actually put your website infront of potential customers. Something that I didn't do at first was put keywords that involved user intent. Most of my first keywords looked like "ux ui", "graphic design", "website design", etc. I was curious to see how my keywords were so I put them in gemini to see what how it thought I was doing with them. One of the main things that it suggested was to add more keywords with user intent, and also change the match type to be more specific. I defaulted everything to broad because that is what was on the example that was provided. For the high intent words I changed the match type to exact match, and for almost all of the others I did phrase match. This all was the purpose of making the google ads campaign run better and be the most effective. I realized that having the idea of what you want your customers to do can really impact the keywords that you choose</p>
        <h2>Making better Ads</h2>
        <p>
            Ads are an important part of getting your business infront of potential customers. Having a good ad campaign is vital to having an effective ad campaign. If your ad isn't effective you will end up spending more money than you will get from your ad. Google has some tools to help you make sure that your ads will work, but another way to see how your ad works is simple trial and error. Using both of these tactics will bring you the best ad for what you need. Being able to use Google's tools to get started, then watching which ad combinations work the best and bring the conversion that you are wanting. As well as providing tools to see how Google says the ad will do, Google also privides ways to track which ad combinations work best. I'm looking forward to continuing to tweak my ads to get the best possible results from the campaign

        <h2>Quality & Relevance Score</h2>
        <p>
            I felt like quality and relevance score really came down to how well thoughout your website is, and how well thoughout everything that links to it is. The discussion example had some pretty obvious and glaring errors in it. The ad was for rigby homes, and it opened to an IF homes page. Some of my classmates mentioned that the link threw them off, but it didn't bother me too much because if you are looking into the Rigby area you have probably seen Idaho Falls and recogize that it is close by. But whoever put the ad together could very easily have done a quick link check to make sure that it opened to the right page. Increasing these scores is really just a game of details. When you make sure the details are right, and are delivering what the user wants, your score will go up. This does mean that you will often need to be checking these details, if you change part of your ad, you need to make sure that doesn't effect the flow of the user.

        <h2>ROI & Ad Optimization</h2>
        <p>
            Learning about tracking your ROI was insightful. Since launching my ad campaign I have been tracking the traffic on my website both on google ads, and through the form submisson process that comes with my hosting site. As I have been monitoring the ad I have noticed that the conversion tracking has been a little off. Google ads shows that the conversion tracking for the form has been triggered 16 times, but so far I have recieved email requests 3 times. After doing a little bit of research I found out that I need to track down and find all the places that the script to track conversions is running, as it will typically run when the page is loaded, not when the form is submitted. I have enjoyed seeing how the ad has been working, and continuing to work on my website to improve the experience of the user so they will be more likely to submit the form to request a design. Using the different tools has helped me to figure out how to optimize my website to also optimize the ads so that I can have the best ROI possible.

        <h2>SEO</h2>
        <p>
            SEO is something that has interested me since I first heard about it, and I actually had started the process of starting a business that helps improve SEO before this class started, which made some of the activities of this class really easy since I had already done the process of creating a website, getting a domain, and hosting. Even knowing this, and diving into SEO while starting that business, it was interesting to see how much more I learned by implementing some of the best practices into my freelance site. A lot of the things that were talked about, having keywords in the text of your site, having optimzed webpages, and simple things like that helped me to realize that having good SEO really helps your business find its niche. You need to really crack down on what you want to do, and then make sure your website mirrors that so that when you go and try to make your site findable, the people who you want to find your site, will find it.
